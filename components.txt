PLEASE NOTE: I shop around to get the best deals and so should you. The links below are only to provide detailed product information.

(1) Arduino Uno R3 (https://robu.in/product/arduino-uno-r3/): This the the primary development board and is the most expensive component. 
For the Beginners, genuine Made in Italy, board is recommended. This is beacuse it supports all the libraries and does not require additional drivers.
Advanced users can go for the Made in China, CH340 version. This requires additional drivers to be installed which are widely available over the internet.

(2) Servo Motors (https://robu.in/product/towerpro-sg90-9gm-1-2kg-180-degree-rotation-servo-motor-good-quality/)- There are light performance motors which can be powered off the Arduino board.
They have a very low stall torque and will not work for higher loads.

(3) Assorted LEDS (https://robu.in/product/10mm-dip-led-blue-10-pcs/): A mixture of LEDs can be used depending on iser preferences

(4) 220 ohm resistors (https://robu.in/product/220-ohm-0-25w-metal-film-resistor/): These are the most common resistors to be added in series circuit with all kinds of LEDs

(5) Buzzer (https://robu.in/product/5v-passive-buzzer/): This is required to build the buzzer circuit


(6)100 ohm resistor (https://robu.in/product/0-25w-100-ohm-resistor-pack-of-100/): This is required to be in series with the buzzer

(7)Assorted Jumper cables (https://robu.in/product/20cm-dupont-wire-color-jumper-cable-2-54mm-1p-1p-female-female-40pcs/): The three different DuPont types are
male-to male, male-to-femaile and female to female. DuPont connector Jumper wires are recommended for beginners as they eliminate a lot of soldering work. 
Later on, you can just use busted hone charging cables and custom make your cables

(8) Soldering Equipment or a nearby mobile repair shop: Theoretically, you can complete the entire setup using jumper wires/ breadboard.
However, for components such as resistors it is cheaper to solder them directly on to LEDS. Ig you do not have prior soldering experience, you can go to the neighborhood
mobile repair shop. Those guys work on much nimbler electronics and will be able to solder your circuits from the blueprint. 

(9) Heat shrink sleeve (https://robu.in/product/heat-shrink-sleeve-1mm-red-5meter-industrial-grade-woer-hst/): Electrical tape cab be used to insulate solders and
other connections. However, it tends to gets sticky. Heat shrink sleeve is a more elegant solution and can be easily heated with a hair dryer.
