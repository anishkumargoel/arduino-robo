Simple Robot Framework
Aim is to build a low cost STEM toy which allows push button input and controls Servo, LEDs and Buzzer

Arduino Ecosystem has endless possibilities. You can build a system to switch ON/OFF a LED or even build a face detecting, email sending Vault. However, for a beginner the harware and code can be daunting. I stil have to depend on the neighborhood mobile repair shop to solder my more complex circuits. However, the coding and hardware complexity can be simplified  by writing diffent tasks as functions. This is my attempt to build a low cost, beginner level arduino robotic framework. I will start with the most basic kaypad input and LED/Servo/Buzzer output. At later stages, I will add more sensor inputs and motor/ web outputs.
